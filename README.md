# Tree data structure

This code is simple implementation of binary tree data structures in C. Implementation has been created for study purposes, not for real usage. Binary tree is fully implemented, but not optimized. Data type is implemented as `void` for easy retype.

## Usage

In `main.c` is example usage for this code. his function starts menu with options:

1. Help menu
2. Insert data
3. Delete data
4. Print sorted data
5. Print graph of tree
6. Reset iterator
7. Get first item
8. Get next item
9. Print fast test
10. Exit

This options show of usage of individual functions of implementation.
